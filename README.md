# Free Online CS Degree Resources
Calling all self-taught aspiring software engineers! Many of us cannot turn back the clock and go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science. C'est la vie. However, that doesn't mean we cannot learn CS topics on our own. For free! This page contains a curated list of open-source resources to master CS topics.

## About the Information Below

All courses are organized into tables. The **order** columns do not refer to course number designations, but instead sequence orders. Meaning, if several courses have the same pre-requisites, then they will have the same order numbers. Although I do not feel textbooks, notes, and online courses are the best way to learn, the majority of the open-source resources listed below fall into these information buckets. Go figure! With so much information available on the web it is impossible for me to find the _"best resources"_ for use. Subjectively, the recommended resources are listed on the table from left-to-right in order from most-to-least time consuming way to learn. I pretended each course was worth 3 credit hours, although I know this is not the case at many institutions that include lab components.

## Math Courses (21 hours)

_CM-1 is actually a CS course, yet I added the "CM" prefix because it's a CS course with a math pre-requisite._
