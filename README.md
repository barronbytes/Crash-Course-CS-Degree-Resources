# Free Online CS Degree Resources
Calling all self-taught aspiring software engineers! Major degree requirements from Kennesaw State University, Georgia State University, and The University of Georgia were reviewed to identify what computer science students study. Below, you'll find the suggested course order progressions, along with free open-source resources to master related concepts.

I advice against using each free resource mentioned here. Yet, I compiled this information for those who wish to know the breadth of knowledge involved in studying computer science. It's a lot!
